# Tissue_Nonvariable_450K_CpGs
Scripts and lists of CpGs which are seen as non-variable in GEO data on the 450K.



## Validation
In a study of 25 blood samples @lmcewen ~108,000/114,000 blood invariable CpGs were non-variable. 

In PAWS @redgar598 (buccals) 99.5% of the buccal non-variable CpGs are also invariable in PAWS
